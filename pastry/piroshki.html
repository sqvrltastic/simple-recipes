I use as little mayo as possible because I use it just to make ingredients stick together better.</em></p><hr><h2 id=directions>Directions</h2><h3 id=making-the-dough>Making the dough</h3><p>Start with activating your dry yeast by soaking with a small amount of liquid, four and sugar. You can take those out of your overall amounts. Leave for around 10 minutes. After some time you should see a layer of bubbles on the surface, if you don&rsquo;t see it, or they look lackluster, throw it away.</p><p>Mix your yeast mixture, milk, water, sugar, salt and whisked eggs (¾ of the whole amount) together. Gradually add in 600 g of flour until homogenous and not lumpy. Knead for a while.</p><p>Add in softened butter and fold it into your dough. It <em>will</em> be sticky and messy, no way around it. Sprinkle a bit of extra flour so you can handle it easier if needed and help yourself with a dough scraper. Knead until your dough becomes elastic and the butter fully incorporates.</p><p>Grab a big bowl and brush it lightly with oil (helps with getting out dough afterward). Shape your dough into a smooth ball and toss it there. Cover it up with a food wrap or towel so it doesn&rsquo;t dry out and leave it for about an hour or two or until the dough doubles in size. Make sure your room is on a warmer side if you want it to rise faster.</p><p>Take out your dough, squeeze the air out by kneading it a little bit, and divide it into equal pieces. Then take one piece, squash it by hand into a thin circle approximately the size of your palm and put a generous amount of filling in the center, just make sure you can still close it afterward and it won&rsquo;t burst.</p><p>To do so, the traditional way is to fold the circle-shaped dough in half and pinch the seam around the filling. You get a bun that has the shape that vaguely resembles a big thick almond with a seam in the middle. Hopefully that makes sense.</p><p>Put your buns on a baking tray (seam side up or down, either way is fine), making sure to leave a generous amount of free space in between to account for them expanding in size later on. Cover with food wrap so they don&rsquo;t dry out and leave to rest for a final proofing for another 30 minutes to an hour. Afterward, brush them with a generous amount of egg wash and, if you want, sprinkle with sesame seeds and put into a preheated oven on 220 °C for around 15 minutes or until golden.</p><hr><h3 id=cabbage--egg-filling-1>Cabbage & egg filling</h3><p>Cut fresh cabbage into tiny bits (alternatively grate it). Fry on a high heat with butter and vegetable oil. Sprinkle salt to taste. Add a splash of milk. Fry until it turns slightly yellow. Don&rsquo;t fry for too long so it doesn&rsquo;t lose its crunchiness. Remove from heat and set aside.</p><p>Make a few hard-boiled eggs. To do so, place your desired amount of eggs in <em>cold</em> water, add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil, then remove from heat. Keep them in hot water for 10 minutes. Then, transfer your eggs into an ice-cold (actually add a few ice cubes) water bath for a few more minutes to cool off. This helps to peel them cleanly. Remove the crust and cut the eggs into tiny bits, then add them to fried cabbage.</p><p>Optionally, add a little bit of mayo into the mix, not enough to taste, but just enough so the filling sticks together better and doesn&rsquo;t crumble as easily.</p><hr><h2 id=credits>Credits</h2><p>Dough recipe is taken from
