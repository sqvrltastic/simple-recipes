  <h1>Piroski</h1>
  <p>
    <i>
      Yet another variant of the "filling in the dough" formula. Mostly popular
      in Russia and Eastern Europe.
    </i>
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <h3>For the dough:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>600 g (maybe a bit more) all purpose flour</li>
    <li>150 ml milk</li>
    <li>150 ml water</li>
    <li>6 g dry yeast</li>
    <li>40 g white sugar</li>
    <li>tsp of salt</li>
    <li>70 g softened butter</li>
    <li>
      2 eggs, whisked together (leave approximately ¼ of the amount for glazing
      the piroskis)
    </li>
    <li>(optional) sesame seeds for decoration</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <i>
      This amount of dough yields approximately 18 to 24 piroskis. You will need
      approximately 1kg of filling for this amount of dough, so plan
      accordingly.
    </i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Choose any of the following fillings... Or use your own.</i>
  </p>
  <h3>Ground meat filling:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>ground meat (usually a mix of beef and pork)</li>
    <li>onions</li>
    <li>cumin seeds</li>
    <li>beef stock cube</li>
    <li>cornstarch</li>
    <li>salt</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Chicken liver & heart filling:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>chicken liver and heart</li>
    <li>onions</li>
    <li>carrots</li>
    <li>(optional) champignon mushrooms</li>
    <li>flour</li>
    <li>heavy cooking cream</li>
    <li>freshly ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>freshly ground coriander</li>
    <li>thyme</li>
    <li>salt</li>
    <li>butter & vegetable oil for frying</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Cabbage & egg filling:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>cabbage</li>
    <li>splash of milk</li>
    <li>hard boiled eggs</li>
    <li>pinch of mayo</li>
    <li>salt</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Note than I did not state exact measurements for the ingredients used to
    make the filling. Usually I go equal ratios meat to veggies and adjust
    spices to taste; start with at least a teaspoon of spices and salt to 1 kg
    of filling.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also remember that with onions, you should grab more than you think you will
    need since they shrink a lot in size as they caramelize, almost twice the
    amount. Try it out as you go.
  </p>
  <p>
    As always, do remember to use freshly ground spices instead of pre-ground
    stuff.
  </p>

  <h2>Directions:</h2>
  <h3>Making the dough:</h3>
  <p>
    Start with activating your dry yeast by soaking with small amount of liquid,
    four and sugar. You can take those out of your overall amounts. Leave for
    around 10 minutes. After some time you should see a layer of bubbles on the
    surface, if you don't see it or they look lackluster, throw it away.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mix your yeast mixture, milk, water, sugar, salt and whisked eggs (¾ of the
    whole amount) together. Gradually add in 600 g of flour until homogenous and
    not lumpy. Knead for a while.
  </p>
  <p>
    Add in softened butter and fold it into your dough. It <em>will</em> be
    sticky and messy, no way around it. Sprinkle a bit of extra flour so you can
    handle it easier if needed and help yourself with a dough scrapper. Knead
    until your dough becomes elastic and the butter fully incorporates.
  </p>
  <p>
    Grab a big bowl and brush it lightly with oil (helps with getting out dough
    afterwards). Shape your dough into a smooth ball and toss it there. Cover it
    up with a food wrap or towel so it doesn't dry out and leave it for about an
    hour or two or until the dough doubles in size. Make sure your room is on a
    warmer side if you want it to rise faster.
  </p>
  <p>
    Take out your dough, squeeze the air out by kneading it a little bit, and
    divide it into large amount of small equal pieces. Then take one piece,
    squash it by hand into a thin circle approximately the size of your palm and
    and put a generous amount of filling in the center, just make sure you can
    still close it afterwards and it won't burst.
  </p>
  <p>
    To do so, the traditional way is to fold the circle shaped dough in half and
    pinch the seam around the filling, so you get a bun that has the shape that
    vaguely resembles big thick almond with a seam in the middle; hopefully that
    makes sense.
  </p>
  <p>
    Put your buns on a baking tray (seam side up or down, either way is fine),
    making sure to leave a generous amount of free space in between to account
    for them expanding in size later on. Cover with food wrap so they don't dry
    out and leave to rest for a final proofing for another 30 minutes to an
    hour. Afterwards, brush them with a generous amount of egg wash and, if you
    want, sprinkle with sesame seeds and put into a preheated oven on 220°C for
    around 15 minutes or until golden.
  </p>

    <i>
      Tip: When frying, never dump raw meat, onions, carrots, etc together into
      skillet because each individual ingredient requires different time to get
      cooked. Something like onions need lots of time to caramelize, while e.g.
      chicken liver gets cooked very quickly.
    </i>
  </p>
  <h3>Making the ground meat filling:</h3>
  <p>
    Chop your onions into very small pieces, sprinkle some salt, but not too
    much as we'll be making it saltier later and fry on a high heat on the
    stove. For best taste, use both butter and vegetable oil (I use sunflower
    oil) for frying. Fry them for a while and stir regularly until they shrink
    in size, turn golden brown (not burned!) and caramelize. Remove from heat.
    Set them aside somewhere.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, fry your ground meat. I use sunflower oil for frying. Make sure to
    spread it evenly and thinly in a skillet. Again, you can sprinkle some salt,
    but don't add too much as we'll be adding salty gravy afterwards. Fry on
    high heat and <em>don't</em> stir it too much. You want it to brown for a
    bit on one side, then flip it and wait for it to brown again. You really
    want to get that pretty brown color in your meat, not gray. Note that it
    <em>will</em> dry out your ground meat slightly and make it very crumbly,
    but, we will fix that in a later step. Once you're done, remove it from heat
    and set aside. Mix it with caramelized onions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we're going to make very basic gravy sauce. Simply grab yourself a beef
    stock cube and dissolve it in boiling water. We only need a few tablespoons
    of it for 1 kg of meat so probably don't make too much of it. I deliberately
    didn't write exact amounts because I want you to adjust it to your liking.
    Try out your stock for a desired saltiness and flavor. If it's too strong,
    you can dilute it with more hot water. If it doesn't have enough flavor,
    similarly, just add more stock cube.
  </p>
  <p>
    Make cornstarch slurry that we'll be using to thicken our broth into gravy
    sauce. You'll need 1:2 ratio cornstarch to water. So, in a small bowl, which
    together one tsp of cornstarch and two tsp of water until you have no lumps.
    This amount is roughly enough for one large cup of water of sauce. It may
    look a bit too runny, but remember that the sauce will thicken more once
    it's cooled off and we don't want to have a jelly either.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway, add your cornstarch slurry into hot stock and stir continuously on
    high heat until it thickens, then remove and let cool off. Once it's cooled
    off, add some of it to your meat & onion mix. Mix well and try out for
    yourself. The sauce should add the moisture and flavor back and also being
    slightly gelatinous will keep the filling from crumbling too much. Also add
    cumin seeds to taste.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h3>Chicken liver & heart filling:</h3>
  <p>
    Slice chicken liver & heart into small bits, approximately 1 cm in size. Put
    them in a bowl and drizzle with some olive oil, a sprinkle of lemon juice
    and your spices: thyme, freshly ground nutmeg and crushed coriander. Make
    sure everything is evenly coated and mixed well, cover it and leave for at
    least half an hour or more to marinate in the fridge.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use both butter and vegetable oil (again, I use sunflower usually) for
    frying. Put your marinated chicken liver and heart on a skillet, add a bit
    of salt and fry on high heat, stirring frequently. Do note that it cooks
    really fast and the moment it changes color and is cooked through, you want
    to remove it from heat immediately. You really don't want to fry it for too
    much time because it will stop being moist and tender.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thinly grate carrots on a grater and fry it as well with bit of salt, butter
    and vegetable oil. Fry until it's softened a little bit and has slightly
    browned bits. Remove from heat and add to fried chicken liver & heart.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fry and caramelize onions (already explained above) and (optionally) you can
    also add fried caramelized champignons, cut into small bits. Use fresh ones
    only, no pickled stuff. Add everything into mix and if needed, season with
    some extra salt, thyme, nutmeg and coriander.
    <span class="spoiler">I LOVE MOREEE SPICES!!! DO IT!</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    Put everything back onto a skillet on medium heat, sprinkle with all purpose
    flour and drizzle with heavy cooking cream (around 33% fat). Stir frequently
    until liquid thickens. Remove from heat.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h3>Cabbage & egg filling:</h3>
  <p>
    Cut fresh cabbage into tiny bits (alternatively grate it). Fry on a high
    heat with butter and vegetable oil. Sprinkle salt to taste. Add a splash of
    milk. Fry until it turns slightly yellow. Don't fry for too long so it
    doesn't lose it's crunchiness. Remove from heat and set aside.
  </p>
  <p>
    Make a few hard boiled eggs. To do so, place your desired amount of eggs in
    <em>cold</em> water, add a pinch of salt and brings to boil, then remove
    from heat. Keep them in hot water for 10 minutes. Then, transfer your eggs
    into a ice cold (actually add a few ice cubes) water bath for a few more
    minutes to cool off. This helps peeling them cleanly. Remove the crust and
    cut the eggs into tiny bits, then add them to fried cabbage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Optionally, add a little bit of mayo into the mix, not enough to taste, but
    just enough so the filling sticks together better and doesn't crumble as
    easily.
