That is what I will be using.</p><p>Yields... 6 Lava cakes. Duh!</p><h2>Directions</h2><p>Rub the inside of your ramekins with butter, then lightly dust it with flour by sprinkling some flour inside, rotating the ramekin and gently tapping at it, then removing the excess flour if there is any. This is done to prevent the cakes sticking to the ramekins.</p><p>Grab a pot and set your stove on low heat. Toss in your chocolate and butter and stir it frequently until they fully melt. No, it won't burn if you do it right, relax. Remove from heat and set aside.</p><p>In a large bowl crack your eggs and add two egg yolks (you can store the extra egg whites and utilize them later in whatever you want). Add sugar and salt and use a mixer until the mixture gets thick, bubbly and fluffy.</p><p>Slowly, bit by bit, pour your melted chocolate into the egg mixture, stirring constantly. After you're done, add flour, bit by bit, all while stirring until it fully incorporates and you don't see any lumps. You can use mixer. Next, fill your ramekins up to ¾ of their volume with the batter.</p><p>Bake for 8 minutes at 230° C in a pre-heated oven. <strong>Set a timer.</strong> Monitor them and don't let them overbake because you want the middle part to still be runny. Also, remember that they continue to cook themselves for a bit longer even after you take them out of the oven.</p><p>Pop them out of the ramekins by placing a plate on the top of the ramekin, then flipping them over. Try tapping them with a spoon to help them come out if they're stuck. Good luck btw lol. Lightly dust with powdered sugar (you can use a small fine flour sifter) and serve immediately. Add some ice cream on the side if you want to.</p><h2>Credits</h2><p>Recipe originally adapted from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW3JtHpuzrk" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">this recipe video</a> by Preppy Kitchen channel on YouTube.</p><p>> <a href=#main>Back to top</a></p></main><footer><p>&copy; 2026 Simple Recipes</p></footer></div></body></html>
