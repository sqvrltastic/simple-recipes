            <title>Website update #5</title>
            <description>
                <p>Added new recipe — <a href="./salads/imitation-crab-sticks-salad.html">Imitation crab sticks salad</a></p>
                <p>
                    Removed meat based fillings from my Piroshki recipe because I feel I don't
                    like them as much and they take too long to make.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Redid my RSS feed a bit! Nothing major but, if you want to see changes, you can
                    unsubscribe and resubscribe and don't forget to clear your reader's cache!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, I converted all my recipe files to Markdown and I love it so much more
                    than working with HTML because it's so much more readable, but that's besides
                    the point and doesn't really matter for the end user (you!).

                Fixed a ton of minor grammatical errors and typos. Google docs and VSCode LTeX+ to the rescue!

            <title>Website update #3</title>
            <description>
                Published a new recipe - Finnish blueberry pie.
                Also made some changes to the website's CSS style sheet to
                make it easier to maintain and cleaned up some messy code.
                Additionally, I rewrote some bits of my zucchini pancakes recipe,
                nothing major or significant though.
                Aaand some other minor technical fixes here and there...

            <title>Website update #2</title>
            <description>
                Implemented some minor improvements and fixes for the website.
                All external links now open in a new browser window.
                Adding to this, also changed the 88x31 button's code that
                was meant for embedding so that when a user clicks on it, it
                opens the link in a new window as well.
