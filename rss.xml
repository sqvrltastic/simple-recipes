                Published a new recipe - Finnish blueberry pie.
                Also made some changes to website's CSS style sheet to
                make it easier to maintain and cleaned up some messy code.
                Additionally, rewrote some bits of my zucchini pancakes recipe,
                nothing major or significant though.
                Aaand some other minor technical fixes here and there...

                Implemented some minor improvements and fixes for the website.
                All external links now open in a new browser window.
                Adding to this, also changed the 88x31 button's code that
                was meant for embedding so that when a user clicks on it, it
                opens the link in a new window as well.
