                </p>
                <p>
                    Also made some changes to website's CSS style sheet to
                    make it easier to maintain and cleaned up some messy code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, rewrote some bits of my zucchini pancakes recipe,
                    nothing major or significant though.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aaand some other minor technical fixes here and there...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I prettied up this RSS feed text formatting a bit.

                    Implemented some minor improvements and fixes for the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All external links now open in a new browser window.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adding to this, also changed the 88x31
                    button's code that was meant for embedding so that when a user clicks on it, it
                    opens the link in a new window as well.
                </p>
