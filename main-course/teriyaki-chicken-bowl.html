  <h1>Teriyaki chicken bowl</h1>
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>bottle of teriyaki chicken sauce (I like House of asia)</li>
    <li>1kg of boneless chicken thighs (I hate breasts, sorry)</li>
    <li>1 cup of white long grained rice</li>
    <li>1 big piece of broccoli</li>
    <li>sesame seeds</li>
    <li>salt for seasoning</li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <h2>Directions:</h2>
  <h3>Cooking the rice:</h3>
  <p>
    Usually the rice to water ratio is 1:2, although with mine I tend to add a
    bit less water, maybe more like 1:1,75. Measure your desired amounts. Keep
    in mind, as you might already know, rice doubles in size when cooked.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rinse your rice in cold water to remove excess starch to prevent stickiness
    after being cooked. Repeat until the water runs clean.
  </p>
  <p>
    Add your rice and cold water to a cooking pot and add salt. I personally add
    1 tsp of salt to 1 cup of rice, or ½ if you like your rice less salty.
  </p>
  <p>
    Put on a stove and bring to boil, then reduce heat to low and leave for 15
    to 20 minutes (read your rice instructions on a package). Remember, no
    peeking! Doing so will make steam that's used to cook rice escape and ruin
    it.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the timer runs out, remove from heat and fluff the rice with fork.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h3>Cooking broccoli:</h3>
  <p>
    Cut stalks away from the florets so you get small bite size pieces of
    broccoli. Dump everything into a large cooking pot, season lightly with salt
    and pour in boiling water until they're covered. Cook for 10 minutes. I like
    them when they don't taste raw, but are still be crunchy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using frozen broccoli is also fine, although you may need to adjust your
    timings.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h3>Preparing chicken thighs:</h3>
  <p>
    Remove skin and excess fat from chicken thighs. Cut them into small pieces,
    1,5 cm to 2 cm in size. Dump them into a preheated pan with a sprinkle of
    vegetable oil. Add a pinch of salt, but not too much as a lot of saltiness
    will come from teriyaki sauce. Fry them until they start getting slightly
    golden brown on their sides. Don't fry for too long or they will dry out.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reduce heat to low or remove from the heat completely and pour teriyaki
    sauce to taste, but make sure they are well covered. Sprinkle on a generous
    amount of sesame seeds and mix again.
  </p>

  <p class="lastp">
    To assemble the bowl, first put in some rice, then on one half on the bowl
    put a few broccoli pieces and on the other put your teriyaki chicken.
