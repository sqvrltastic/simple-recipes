Measure your desired amounts. Keep in mind, as you might already know, rice doubles in size when cooked.</p><p>Rinse your rice in cold water to remove excess starch to prevent stickiness after being cooked. Repeat until the water runs clean.</p><p>Add your rice and cold water to a cooking pot and add salt. I personally add 1 tsp of salt to 1 cup of rice, or ½ if you like your rice less salty.</p><p>Put on a stove and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and leave for 15 to 20 minutes (read your rice instructions on a package). Remember, no peeking! Doing so will make steam that's used to cook rice escape and ruin it.</p><p>After the timer runs out, remove from heat and fluff the rice with a fork.</p><h3>Cooking broccoli</h3><p>Cut stalks away from the florets so you get small bite size pieces of broccoli. Dump everything into a large cooking pot, season lightly with salt and pour in boiling water until they're covered. Cook for 10 minutes. I like them when they don't taste raw, but are still crunchy.</p><p>Using frozen broccoli is also fine, although you may need to adjust your timings.</p><h3>Preparing chicken thighs</h3><p>Remove skin and excess fat from chicken thighs. Cut them into small pieces, 1.5 cm to 2 cm in size. Dump them into a preheated pan with a sprinkle of vegetable oil. Add a pinch of salt, but not too much as a lot of saltiness will come from teriyaki sauce. Fry them until they start getting slightly golden brown on their sides. Don't fry for too long, or they will dry out.</p><p>Reduce heat to low or remove from the heat completely and pour teriyaki sauce to taste, but make sure they are well covered. Sprinkle on a generous amount of sesame seeds and mix again.</p><h3>Put everything together</h3><p>To assemble the bowl, first put in some rice, then on one half of the bowl put a few broccoli pieces and on the other put your teriyaki chicken.</p><p>> <a href=#main>Back to top</a></p></main><footer><p>&copy; 2026 Simple Recipes</p></footer></div></body></html>
