  <h1>Chicken pilaf</h1>
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 boneless chicken thighs (about 1 kg)</li>
    <li>900 g onions (it shrinks considerably when cooked)</li>
    <li>500 g carrots</li>
    <li>
      500 g white long grained rice (I recommend basmati rice, but other types
      can work too)
    </li>
    <li>1 whole garlic, not peeled</li>
    <li>2 tbsp cumin seeds</li>
    <li>2 tbsp dried barberries</li>
    <li>(optional) any other premade plov/pilaf seasoning of your choice</li>
    <li>salt, to taste</li>
    <li>vegetable oil, butter and water</li>
  </ul>
  <i>
    A dutch oven is highly recommended. I will be using it throughout whole
    process.
  </i>
  <hr />
  <h2>Directions:</h2>
  <p>
    Chop onions into small bits, salt to taste and fry on high heat in the dutch
    oven util they caramelize. Then remove from heat and set aside.
  </p>
  <p>
    Grab a cheese grater and grate your carrots on a side with large holes.
    Sprinkle some salt and fry until they become soft. Remove from heat and mix
    in with your onions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remove skin and excess fat from chicken thighs and cut them into small
    pieces, around 1,5 cm to 2 cm in size. Sprinkle some salt and fry them until
    they start getting slightly golden on their sides. Don't fry for too long or
    they will dry out.
  </p>
  <p>
    Add everything back to dutch oven and mix together, then add your spices and
    add boiling hot water just enough so everything is covered. Make sure to try
    out your broth and add more salt if needed. The amount of salt might be a
    bit tricky to get right the first time, but remember that the rice will soak
    up a lot of it, so you will want a broth that tastes just a little bit more
    salty that you'd usually like. Of course, it's better to have undersalted
    your dish than oversalted. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 15 minutes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rinse your rice in cold water to remove excess starch until the water runs
    clear. Add it on top of your broth and spread evenly. Add more boiling hot
    water until the rice is fully submerged, maybe half a centimeter more. This
    is also the part where you can insert the whole garlic in the center and
    cover it all and simmer on low to medium for about 20 minutes, without
    constantly peeking.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note on garlic, it's mostly added to make the dish more aromatic and then
    it's removed afterwards. You don't have to toss it away though; cooked
    trough it's pretty tasty. Personally I just cut of the dirty brown root part
    and maybe a dirty outer layer of peel, but the rest of it I just rinse with
    water until I don't see any dirt left. Don't peel it or break it into
    chunks.
  </p>
  <p class="lastp">
    After 20 minutes, the pilaf should be ready. Sometimes the rice grains
    aren't cooked evenly and when that happens I stir everything and let it cook
    a bit more on low heat, sometimes adding just a drizzle of hot water so it
    doesn't burn. afterwards, remove the garlic (but don't throw it away! It's
    delicious!) and serve.
