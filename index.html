<h1>About</h1>
<h2>What is this website?</h2>
<p>
  Simple recipes is a website I made as a hobby project to learn HTML and CSS
  and also to catalogue and organize my favorite recipes I collected over the
  years.
</p>
<p>
  I used to just dump all of the recipes I came across in my private Discord
  channel, which I suppose many would relate to, but over time I realized that I
  want to somehow refine and organize all of them. So I decided to make a
  website.
</p>
<p>
  Consider this my digital notebook that I mostly made for myself, but decided
  to share with others because you might find some of it useful for yourself.
  Note that I do not make any money whatsoever from any of the content posted
  here. Again, it's just for organizational purposes.
</p>
<p>
  This website has no ads or trackers and does not need any JavaScript to
  function. I tried to make it as light on resources as possible. It is built
  with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">HUGO static website generator</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Most recipes here are not something super elaborate or fancy nor do I claim
  the title of master chef or anything like that. Cooking is just my hobby and
  my goal was primarily to compile a list of recipes that are simple to make and
  utilize easy to find ingredients. All recipes here are tested by me.
</p>
<p>Some other things to note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I'm European, so all measurements are in grams, meters, Celsius and I
    utilize European ingredients.
  </li>
  <li>
    I don't include calory count or nutritional data because I don't consider it
    important for me, sorry.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since I usually cook for more than one person, most recipe yield enough food
    for two to three people eating.
  </li>
  <li>
    My measuring cup is 200 ml, my teaspoon and tablespoons are... Well standard
    metal teaspoons and tablespoons I use for eating.
  </li>
  <li>
    I'm a meat eater, so although some recipes are vegetarian, vegan/vegetarian
    recipes is not something I focus on.
  </li>
  <li>
    This site has an RSS feed.
    <img src="./images/rss.svg" alt="" width="15px" height="15px" />
    <a href="./rss.xml">Click here!</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Right now there is only a handful of recipes, but I plan to slowly add more in
  the future.
</p>
<h2>Note on accessibility:</h2>
<p>
  This website is tested and confirmed to work on Firefox and Edge (Chromium)
  and should display correctly with wide range of zoom levels and screen
  resolutions. This website is mobile friendly, but was primarily developed for
  desktop. It should work with keyboard-only navigation.
</p>
<p>
  I also tested it with NVDA on both Firefox and Edge. Most things
  <em>should</em> work correctly although there are some minor TTS pronunciation
  issues that I am unsure of how to fix as of now.
</p>
<p>
  Please reach out to me if you spot any grammar mistake or typo or if you have
  any suggestion on how to improve accessibility and responsiveness of this
  website! My email is listed below...
