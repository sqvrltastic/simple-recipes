favorite recipes I collected over the years.</p><p>Like many others, I used to dump all the recipes I came across in my private Discord channel (lol), but over
time, I realized that I want to somehow refine and organize all of them. So I decided to make a website! 💫</p><p>Consider this my digital scrapbook that I mostly made for myself, but decided to share with others because you might
find some of it useful.</p><p>Most recipes here are not something super elaborate or fancy, nor do I claim the title of master chef or anything
like that. Cooking is just my hobby and my goal was primarily to compile a list of recipes that are simple to make
and utilize easy to find ingredients. All recipes here are tested by me.</p><p>With that said, keep in mind that all content
here is provided "as is" and I won't guarantee that my
tastes are necessarily the same as yours.</p><p>This website has no ads or trackers and does not need any JavaScript to function. I tried to make it as light on
resources as possible. It is built with <a href=https://gohugo.io/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">HUGO
static website generator</a>.</p><p>Also, feel free to reach out to me if you spot any typo or grammar mistakes. My contact info is listed below...</p><h2>Some other things to note…</h2><ul><li>I'm European, so all measurements are in grams, meters, Celsius and I utilize European ingredients.</li><li>I don't include calorie count or nutritional data because I don't consider it important for me, sorry.</li><li>Since I usually cook for more than one person, most recipes yield enough food for two to three people eating.</li><li>My measuring cup is approximately 200 ml, my teaspoon and tablespoons are… Well standard metal teaspoons and
tablespoons I use
for eating.</li><li>I'm a meat eater, so although some recipes are vegetarian, vegan/vegetarian recipes are not something I focus
on.</li><li>This site has an RSS feed. <a href=./rss.xml target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here!</a></li><li>English is not my native language.</li><li>Website's Birthday: <strong>November 20th 2024</strong> 🎂</li></ul><h2>Contact</h2><p>Email: <a href=mailto:sqvrltastic@gmail.com>sqvrltastic@gmail.com</a></p><h2>Banners</h2><h3>88x31 button</h3><img class=button src=assets/images/simple-recipes.gif alt="Simple recipes"><p><em>(In case you want to link to this website. Thanks!)</em></p><h3><i>"What the hell are buttons?!"</i></h3><p>Buttons are small images, most commonly 88 by 31 pixel in size. They can be
static or animated. They are a way for webmasters to exchange links in style
and build a community of websites. They were really popular in the 90s and
early 2000s and they are making a comeback.</p><p>If you have a personal website, you can use one of the button images
and create an image-link that links to this website.</p><h2>My other projects</h2><a href=https://sqvrltastic.art/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=button src=assets/images/sqvrltastic.webp alt="Sqvrltastic's Homepage"></a><h2>Updates</h2><article><h3>Website update</h3><time datetime=2026-02-13>02/13/2026</time><p>Updated the 88x31 button design and added a link to my other website.</p></article><article><h3>Website update</h3><time datetime=2026-02-13>02/13/2026</time><p>Changed the design a bit (yes, AGAIN) and rewrote the landing page text slightly so it sounds better (hopefully).</p></article><article><h3>Website update</h3><time datetime=2026-02-12>02/12/2026</time><p>Updated the code of the website and purchased a domain. ✨</p></article><article><h3>Website update</h3><time datetime=2025-04-03>04/03/2025</time><p>Updated the RSS feed format and website's own update feed.

Nothing major but, if you want to see changes, you can unsubscribe and resubscribe and don’t forget to clear your reader’s cache! Also, I converted all my recipe files to Markdown and I love it so much more than working with HTML because it’s so much more readable, but that’s beside the point and doesn’t really matter for the end user (you!).</p></article><article><h3>New recipe</h3><time datetime=2025-01-15>01/15/2025</time><a href=/salads/imitation-crab-sticks-salad/>Imitation crab sticks salad</a><p>A salad recipe that’s pretty popular in Russia.</p></article><article><h3>Website update</h3><time datetime=2024-12-12>12/12/2024</time><p>Fixed a ton of minor grammatical errors and typos.
